      <h2>Bachelors of Arts in Business Management</h2>
      <p class="Credentials-text">My bachelor’s degree in business management has equipped me with leadership, strategic thinking, and problem-solving skills that drive a company’s growth and efficiency. 
        By understanding how key business functions—such as finance, marketing, and operations—work together, I am able to make informed, data-driven decisions. 
        I also bring strong communication abilities, an entrepreneurial mindset, and adaptability, which help organizations innovate, streamline processes, and foster a positive, collaborative workplace culture.</p>

      <h2>Software Development Certification</h2>
      <p class="Credentials-text">Obtaining a software development certification has given me a competitive edge by assuring companies that their developers adhere to proven, industry‑recognized standards for quality, security, and efficiency. 
        As a certified professional, I bring structured, well‑documented processes to projects, reducing errors, accelerating delivery, and improving maintainability. 
        This not only enhances client trust and satisfaction but also mitigates risks such as costly defects or security breaches. 
        Ultimately, it serves as a mark of credibility that can attract new business, strengthen team performance, and protect the company’s reputation.</p>

      <h2>F.E.M.A Independent Study Disaster Recovery Certifications</h2>
      <p class="Credentials-text">By completing FEMA Independent Study certifications, I bring enhanced emergency preparedness, compliance, and resilience to the company. 
        These courses have provided me with the skills to respond effectively to disasters, coordinate with agencies through the Incident Command System, and follow the National Incident Management System standards. 
        My training helps the organization meet regulatory requirements, reduce downtime, mitigate risks, and build client and stakeholder confidence by demonstrating a strong commitment to safety, continuity, and operational excellence.</p>
